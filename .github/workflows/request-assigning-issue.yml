              Thank you for your interest @{{comment.user.login}}, but it looks like this issue is already assigned to someone.

              🔎 We try to keep issues assigned only to one developer unless they have planned to collaborate directly.
              If you have discussed this issue with the developer currently assigned and would like to help please let us know in a comment and someone from the core team will manually add you to the Issue.

              🔎 If this Issue returns to the backlog for any reason please feel free to request it then.
